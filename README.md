# Vivian Joker

Mod adding a joker after an original character of [Akihari Chiko](https://x.com/akihari_chiko), Vivian

### Requires [Steamodded 1.0.0](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded/wiki/01.-Getting-started) and [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector?tab=readme-ov-file#manual-installation)

## Installation

* Install [Steamodded 1.0.0](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded/wiki/01.-Getting-started)
* Download latest release
* Unzip contents of release archive into `%AppData%/Balatro/Mods`

## Features

Features Vivian as the rare Joker with ability to gain mult with scored spade cards instead of chips

Rulings (and known issues):
* Conversion happens as a joker proc on played scored card, similarly to Wraithful Joker and Arrowhead
* On proc, base chip value of a card (2-11) and chip values of edition (50 for foil) and enchantment (30 for bonus) are subtracted from hand score and that much mult is added instead
* Other effects, including Hiker, that grant chips do not interact with Vivian
* Additional copies of Vivian (through Invisible joker, Showman, Blueprint, etc) do the same, potentially resulting in going into negative chips and actually draining your score. Doing so might bug out score display however 

Additionally, there's also a deck that contains him as a starting joker
