# Vivian Joker

Mod adding a joker after an original character of [Akihari Chiko](https://bsky.app/profile/akihari-chiko.bsky.social), Vivian

### Requires [Steamodded 1.0.0](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded/wiki/01.-Getting-started) and [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector?tab=readme-ov-file#manual-installation)

## Installation

* Install [Steamodded 1.0.0](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded/wiki/01.-Getting-started)
* Download latest release
* Unzip contents of release archive into `%AppData%/Balatro/Mods`

## Features

Features Vivian as the rare Joker with ability to gain mult with scored spade cards instead of chips

Rulings:
* Conversion happens as a joker proc on played scored card, similarly to Wraithful Joker and Arrowhead
* On proc, gain base value of the card, edition and enchanment chip bonuses as mult, and subtract that much from chips
* Other effects that grant chips, like Hiker, do not interact with Vivian
* Chips drain does not stop at 0 and might cause chips to go into negatives (eg. from retriggers), draining your score, including putting score itself into negatives 

Additionally, there's also a deck that contains him as a starting joker with a sticker that removes his sell value (can be still sold)
